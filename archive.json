There was a concern from LAMPS (Deb Cooley) that some implementations might not have access to SHA3/KMAC at the CMS level.  That is, SHA3 may only be at the crypto level (maybe even in an HSM or TPM) since ML-KEM requires it, but many other things don't.  On the other hand, low-resource devices may want to only support SHA3 and not SHA2.\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in LAMPS IETF 119 that we could give the option for either to be supported, with good reasoning to it doesn't get challenged by IESG.\r\n\r\nSuggested text, before I have time to actually write a PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOne of KMAC{128,256} or HKDF-with-SHA{256,512} MUST be supported.

IND-CCA2 corresponds to security against an active attacker, and the public key / secret key pair can be treated as a long-term key or reused. A weaker security notion is indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attacks (IND-CPA), which means that the shared secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings given a copy of the public key. IND-CPA roughly corresponds to security against a passive attacker, and sometimes corresponds to one-time key exchange.\r\n\r\nIND-CCA2 is a desirable property of encryption mechanisms for CMS since encryption public keys are often long-term -- for example contained within X.509 certificates {{?RFC5280}} -- and certain uses of CMS could allow for the type of decryption oracle that forms the basis of an adaptive ciphertext attack.\r\n```",

Or do you still think it's better to just remove it?",
