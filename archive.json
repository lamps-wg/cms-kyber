There was a concern from LAMPS (Deb Cooley) that some implementations might not have access to SHA3/KMAC at the CMS level.  That is, SHA3 may only be at the crypto level (maybe even in an HSM or TPM) since ML-KEM requires it, but many other things don't.  On the other hand, low-resource devices may want to only support SHA3 and not SHA2.\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in LAMPS IETF 119 that we could give the option for either to be supported, with good reasoning to it doesn't get challenged by IESG.\r\n\r\nSuggested text, before I have time to actually write a PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOne of KMAC{128,256} or HKDF-with-SHA{256,512} MUST be supported.

IND-CCA2 corresponds to security against an active attacker, and the public key / secret key pair can be treated as a long-term key or reused. A weaker security notion is indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attacks (IND-CPA), which means that the shared secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings given a copy of the public key. IND-CPA roughly corresponds to security against a passive attacker, and sometimes corresponds to one-time key exchange.\r\n\r\nIND-CCA2 is a desirable property of encryption mechanisms for CMS since encryption public keys are often long-term -- for example contained within X.509 certificates {{?RFC5280}} -- and certain uses of CMS could allow for the type of decryption oracle that forms the basis of an adaptive ciphertext attack.\r\n```",

To my eye, I see that things like id-alg-ml-kem-512 and pk-ml-kem-512 are used but not defined nor imported. And when I try to compile it in ASN.1 playground, I get errors that '&smimeCaps' is not defined for the object 'kema-ml-kem-512'. So I think the ASN.1 module needs some work.\r\n\r\n\r\n> \u201cA compliant implementation MUST support HKDF with SHA-256, using the id-alg-hkdf-with-sha256 KDF object identifier, as the KemRecipientInfo KDF for all ML-KEM parameter sets.\u201d\r\n\r\nPerfect! Simple. That nails it.\r\n\r\nOnce the ASN.1 module compiles and is complete, I agree that this is ready for WGLC.",

Can FIPS publish a new version of the document and mix up\r\nthe numbers?\r\n\r\n> Authors response: This is a fair question to ask the RFC Editor, but our document is consistent with draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates-10 which has, for example:\r\n> \"To support serialization of seed values as private keys, let Algorithm 19b denote the same procedure as Algorithm 19 in [[FIPS203](https://doi.org/10.6028/nist.fips.203)]\"\r\n> I thin this is ok because there will only ever be one document called \"FIPS.203\". If NIST publishes updates, they will name that \"FIPS.203a\".\r\n\r\n> SECDIR comment: 2.1: \"ukm\" sounds like a useless piece of complexity - even some complexity if\r\nyou don't implement it. Given that this is a profile of [RFC 9629](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9629/), couldn't you\r\nremove it?\r\n\r\n> Authors response: \"Useless\" is a bit strong. This provides a way for the application to bind extra context information or out-of-band pre-shared key material. I think we should leave it exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n> SECDIR comment: 2.3, as far as I can tell, you are more strict than [RFC 9629](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9629/) in saying that\r\nonly keyEncipherment must be asserted.\r\n\r\n> Authors response: The issue here is that there exists `keyEncipherment` which usually indicates an RSA Key Transport mechanism, and `keyAgreement` which usually indicates a Diffie-Hellman style key agreement. A KEM does not fit cleanly into either. LAMPS had a big debate about this several years ago and decided that by convention, all KEMs will use the `keyEncipherment` key usage. This is the only key usage allowed for ML-KEM as per draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates.\r\n",

The use of inadequate pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate these values can result in little or no security.  In the case of key generation, a random 32-byte seed is used to deterministically derive the key (with an additional 32 bytes reserved as a rejection value). In the case of encapsulation, a KEM is derived from the underlying ML-KEM public key encryption algorithm by deterministically encrypting a random 32-byte message for the public key.  If the random value is weakly-chosen, then an attacker may find it much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys or ciphertext, searching the resulting small set of possibilities for a matching public key or ciphertext value, rather than performing a more complex algorithmic attack against ML-KEM.  The generation of quality random numbers is difficult; see Section 3.3 of {{FIPS203}} for some additional information.\r\n```",

For example, the ukm value could include a nonce, application-specific context information, or an identifier for the originator.\r\n\r\nSo that can be more than random input, and could have meaningful security benefits for the protocol. For example, you could imagine a \"Falko Attack\" where an encrypted PDF as mistaken for an encrypted S/MIME. Feeding in some static string into UKM that binds the shared secret to the protocol would prevent that attack.\r\n\r\nI suggest this re-wording of the paragraph:\r\n\r\n> ukm is an optional additional keying material that binds the shared secret key to some protocol state, for example a nonce, transaction ID, application-specific context information, or an identifier for the originator. Since not all protocols built on top of CMS will make use of the ukm, CMS implementations MAY choose to not support ukm. Implementations that do not support ukm SHOULD by gracefully discontinue processing when the ukm field is present since failure to do so will result in the derivation of different keying material than the sender.\r\n\r\nTo me, this seems like a trivial part of the spec; it really doesn't save you any effort to implement it, but if we want to make it optional, I think that's the way to do it.",

That sort of wording is appropriate for the KEMRecipientInfo specification, but this document is an algorithm profile of RFC 9629 so should stick to algorithm specifics.  RFC 9629 says \"A KEM algorithm may place requirements on the ukm value.\" In the case of ML-KEM, there are no additional UKM requirements, so we should just stick to saying that.  There are other algorithms, like static DH where the algorithm requires the use of a UKM nonce to ensure a different encryption key is generated each time, but this doesn't apply for ML-KEM.\r\n\r\nAnd with that disagreement, I think the text we had here previously was also too much and should just say \"ML-KEM doesn't care about ukm, do RFC 9629\".  I'll update the PR with proposed text.\r\n\r\nBTW, a \"Falko Attack\" for encryption doesn't apply because it is handled by the content-type signed attribute.  The Falko Attack for signatures is due to a deficiency in CMS where both signed attribute or no signed attributes are allowed.",
