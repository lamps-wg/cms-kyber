--- abstract

The Module-Lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) algorithm is a one-pass (store-and-forward) cryptographic mechanism for an originator to securely send keying material to a recipient using the recipient's ML-KEM public key. Three parameters sets for the ML-KEM algorithm are specified by NIST in {{FIPS203-ipd}} \[EDNOTE: Change to {{FIPS203}} when it is published\]. In order of increasing security strength (and decreasing performance), these parameter sets are ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024. This document specifies the conventions for using ML-KEM with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) using KEMRecipientInfo as specified in {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}.

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

ML-KEM is an IND-CCA2-secure key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) standardized in {{FIPS203}} by the US NIST PQC Project {{NIST-PQ}}.

Native support for Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) was added to CMS in {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}, which defines the KEMRecipientInfo structure for the use of KEM algorithms for the CMS enveloped-data content type, the CMS authenticated-data content type, and the CMS authenticated-enveloped-data content type. This document specifies the direct use of ML-KEM in the KEMRecipientInfo structure in CMS using each of the three parameter sets from {{FIPS203}}, namely MK-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024.  It does not address or preclude the use of ML-KEM as part of any hybrid scheme.

## Conventions and Terminology {#sec-intro-terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

<!-- End of terminology section -->

## ML-KEM {#sec-intro-ml-kem}

ML-KEM is a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism using Module Learning with Errors as its underlying primitive, which is a structured lattices variant that offers good performance and relatively small and balanced key and ciphertext sizes. ML-KEM was standardized with three parameter sets: ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024. These were mapped by NIST to the three security levels defined in the NIST PQC Project, Level 1, 3, and 5. These levels correspond to the hardness of breaking AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 respectively.

Like all KEM algorithms, ML-KEM provides three functions: KeyGen(), Encapsulate(), and Decapsulate().

KeyGen() -> (pk, sk):
: Generate the public key (pk) and a private key (sk).

Encapsulate(pk) -> (ct, ss):
: Given the recipient's public key (pk), produce a ciphertext (ct) to be passed to the recipient and a shared secret (ss) for use by the originator.

Decapsulate(sk, ct) -> ss:
: Given the private key (sk) and the ciphertext (ct), produce the shared secret (ss) for the recipient.

The KEM functions defined above correspond to the following functions in {{FIPS203}}:

KeyGen():
: ML-KEM.KeyGen() from section 6.1.

Encapsulate():
: ML-KEM.Encaps() from section 6.2.

Decapsulate():
: ML-KEM.Decaps() from section 6.3.

All security levels of ML-KEM use SHA3-256, SHA3-512, SHAKE256, and SHAKE512 internally.

# Use of the ML-KEM Algorithm in CMS {#sec-using}

The ML-KEM algorithm MAY be employed for one or more recipients in the CMS enveloped-data content type {{!RFC5652}}, the CMS authenticated-data content type {{!RFC5652}}, or the CMS authenticated-enveloped-data content type {{!RFC5083}}. In each case, the KEMRecipientInfo {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}} is used with the ML-KEM algorithm to securely transfer the content-encryption key from the originator to the recipient.

Processing ML-KEM with KEMRecipientInfo follows the same steps as Section 2 of {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}. To support the ML-KEM algorithm, a CMS originator MUST implement the Encapsulate() function and a CMS responder MUST implement the Decapsulate() function.

## RecipientInfo Conventions {#sec-using-recipientInfo}

When the ML-KEM algorithm is employed for a recipient, the RecipientInfo alternative for that recipient MUST be OtherRecipientInfo using the KEMRecipientInfo structure as defined in {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}.
The fields of the KEMRecipientInfo MUST have the following values:

> version is the syntax version number; it MUST be 0.

> rid identifies the recipient's certificate or public key.

> kem identifies the KEM algorithm; it MUST contain one of id-ML-KEM-512, id-ML-KEM-768, or id-ML-KEM-1024. These identifiers are reproduced in {{sec-identifiers}}.

> kemct is the ciphertext produced for this recipient.

> kdf identifies the key-derivation algorithm. Note that the Key Derivation Function (KDF) used for CMS RecipientInfo process MAY be different than the KDF used within the ML-KEM algorithm.

> kekLength is the size of the key-encryption key in octets.

> ukm is an optional random input to the key-derivation function. ML-KEM doesn't place any requirements on the ukm contents.

> wrap identifies a key wrapping algorithm used to encrypt the content-encryption key.

<!-- End of recipientinfo conventions section -->

## Underlying Components {#sec-using-components}

When ML-KEM is employed in CMS, the security levels of the different underlying components used within the KEMRecipientInfo structure SHOULD be consistent.

### Use of the HKDF-based Key Derivation Function

The HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) is defined in {{!RFC5869}}.

The HKDF function is a composition of the HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand functions.

~~~
HKDF(salt, IKM, info, L)
  = HKDF-Expand(HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM), info, L)
~~~

HKDF(salt, IKM, info, L) takes the following parameters:

salt:
: optional salt value (a non-secret random value). In this document this parameter is unused, that is it is the zero-length string "".

IKM:
: input keying material. In this document this is the shared secret outputted from the Encapsulate() or Decapsulate() functions.  This corresponds to the IKM KDF input from Section 5 of {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}.

info:
: optional context and application specific information. In this document this corresponds to the info KDF input from Section 5 of {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}. This is the ASN.1 DER encoding of CMSORIforKEMOtherInfo.

L:
: length of output keying material in octets. This corresponds to the L KDF input from Section 5 of {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}, which is identified in the kekLength value from KEMRecipientInfo.

HKDF may be used with different hash functions, including SHA2-256 or SHA2-512 {{?FIPS180=NIST.FIPS.180-4}}. The object identifiers id-alg-hkdf-with-sha256 and id-alg-hkdf-with-sha512 are defined in {{!RFC8619}} (see {{sec-identifiers}}), and specify the use of HKDF with SHA2-256 and SHA2-512 respectively. The parameter field MUST be absent when one of these algorithm identifiers is used to specify the KDF for ML-KEM in KemRecipientInfo.

### Use of the KMAC-based Key Derivation Function

KMAC128-KDF and KMAC256-KDF are KMAC-based KDFs specified for use in CMS in {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sha3-hash}}.  Here, KMAC# indicates the use of either KMAC128-KDF or KMAC256-KDF.

KMAC#(K, X, L, S) takes the following parameters:

K:
: the input key-derivation key.  In this document this is the shared secret outputted from the Encapsulate() or Decapsulate() functions.  This corresponds to the IKM KDF input from Section 5 of {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}.

X:
: the context, corresponding to the info KDF input from Section 5 of {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}. This is the ASN.1 DER encoding of CMSORIforKEMOtherInfo.

L:
: the output length, in bits.  This corresponds to the L KDF input from Section 5 of {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}, which is identified in the kekLength value from KEMRecipientInfo.  The L KDF input and kekLength values are specified in octets while this L parameter is specified in bits.

S:
: the optional customization label.  In this document this parameter is unused, that is it is the zero-length string "".

The object identifier for KMAC128-KDF is id-kmac128 and the object identifier for KMAC256-KDF is id-kmac256 (see {{sec-identifiers}}).

Since the customization label to KMAC# is not used, the parameter field MUST be absent when id-kmac128 or id-kmac256 is used as part of an algorithm identifier specifying the KDF to use for ML-KEM in KemRecipientInfo.

### Components for ML-KEM in CMS

An implementation MUST support at least one of KMAC# or HMAC as the KDF for ML-KEM in KemRecipientInfo.  It is RECOMMENDED that a CMS recipient supports both. KMAC# is given as an option because ML-KEM uses SHA3 and SHAKE as internal functions, so an implementation may want to use these to reduce code size. HMAC is given as an option because SHA2 is widely supported and the CMS-level code may not have access to underlying KECCAK-based implementations. Note that the KDF used to process the KEMRecipientInfo structure MAY be different from the KDF used in the ML-KEM algorithm.

For ML-KEM-512, the following underlying components MUST be supported:

> KDF: KMAC128-KDF using id-kmac128 or HMAC with SHA2-256 using id-alg-hkdf-with-sha256

> Key wrapping: 128-bit AES key wrapping using id-aes128-wrap {{!RFC3565}}

For ML-KEM-768, the following underlying components MUST be supported:

> KDF: KMAC256-KDF using id-kmac256 or HMAC with SHA2-512 using id-alg-hkdf-with-sha512

> Key wrapping: 256-bit AES key wrapping using id-aes256-wrap {{!RFC3565}}

For ML-KEM-1024, the following underlying components MUST be supported:

> KDF: KMAC256-KDF using id-kmac256 or HMAC with SHA2-512 using id-alg-hkdf-with-sha512

> Key wrapping: 256-bit AES key wrapping using id-aes256-wrap {{!RFC3565}}

The above object identifiers are reproduced for convenience in {{sec-identifiers}}.

An implementation MAY also support other key-derivation functions and other key-encryption algorithms.

If underlying components other than those specified above are used, then the following KDF requirements are in effect in addition to those asserted in {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}}:

> ML-KEM-512 SHOULD be used with a KDF capable of outputting a key with at least 128 bits of security and with a key wrapping algorithm with a key length of at least 128 bits.

> ML-KEM-768 SHOULD be used with a KDF capable of outputting a key with at least 192 bits of security and with a key wrapping algorithm with a key length of at least 192 bits.

> ML-KEM-1024 SHOULD be used with a KDF capable of outputting a key with at least 256 bits of security and with a key wrapping algorithm with a key length of at least 256 bits.

<!-- End of Underlying Components section -->

## Certificate Conventions {#sec-using-certs}

The conventions specified in this section augment {{!RFC5280}}.

A recipient who employs the ML-KEM algorithm with a certificate MUST identify the public key in the certificate using the id-ML-KEM-512, id-ML-KEM-768, or id-ML-KEM-1024 object identifiers following the conventions specified in {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates}} and reproduced in {{sec-identifiers}}.

In particular, the key usage certificate extension MUST only contain keyEncipherment (Section 4.2.1.3 of {{!RFC5280}}).

## SMIME Capabilities Attribute Conventions {#sec-using-smime-caps}

Section 2.5.2 of {{!RFC8551}} defines the SMIMECapabilities attribute to announce a partial list of algorithms that an S/MIME implementation can support. When constructing a CMS signed-data content type {{!RFC5652}}, a compliant implementation MAY include the SMIMECapabilities attribute that announces support for one or more of the ML-KEM algorithm identifiers.

The SMIMECapability SEQUENCE representing the ML-KEM algorithm MUST include one of the ML-KEM object identifiers in the capabilityID field. When the one of the ML-KEM object identifiers appears in the capabilityID field, the parameters MUST NOT be present.

# Security Considerations {#sec-security-considerations}

\[EDNOTE: many of the security considerations below apply to ML-KEM in general and are not specific to ML-KEM within CMS. As this document and draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates approach WGLC, the two Security Consideration sections should be harmonized and duplicate text removed.]

The Security Considerations sections of {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates}} and {{!I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri}} apply to this specification as well.

The ML-KEM variant and the underlying components need to be selected consistent with the desired security level. Several security levels have been identified in the NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 {{?NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5}}. To achieve 128-bit security, ML-KEM-512 SHOULD be used, the key-derivation function SHOULD provide at least 128 bits of security, and the symmetric key-encryption algorithm SHOULD be AES Key Wrap with a 128-bit key. To achieve 192-bit security, ML-KEM-768 SHOULD be used, the key-derivation function SHOULD provide at least 192 bits of security, and the symmetric key-encryption algorithm SHOULD be AES Key Wrap with a 192-bit key or larger. In this case AES Key Wrap with a 256-bit key is typically used because AES-192 is not as commonly deployed. To achieve 256-bit security, ML-KEM-1024 SHOULD be used, the key-derivation function SHOULD provide at least 256 bits of security, and the symmetric key-encryption algorithm SHOULD be AES Key Wrap with a 256-bit key.

Provided all inputs are well-formed, the key establishment procedure of ML-KEM will never explicitly fail. Specifically, the ML-KEM.Encaps and ML-KEM.Decaps algorithms from {{FIPS203}} will always output a value with the same data type as a shared secret key, and will never output an error or failure symbol. However, it is possible (though extremely unlikely) that the process will fail in the sense that ML-KEM.Encaps and ML-KEM.Decaps will produce different outputs, even though both of them are behaving honestly and no adversarial interference is present. In this case, the sender and recipient clearly did not succeed in producing a shared
secret key. This event is called a decapsulation failure. Estimates for the decapsulation failure probability (or rate) for each of the ML-KEM parameter sets are provided in Table 1 \[EDNOTE: make sure this doesn't change] of {{FIPS203}} and reproduced here in {{tab-fail}}.

|Parameter set | Decapsulation failure rate |
|---           |---                         |
| ML-KEM-512   | 2^(âˆ’139)                   |
| ML-KEM-768   | 2^(âˆ’164)                   |
| ML-KEM-1024  | 2^(âˆ’174)                   |
{: #tab-fail title="ML-KEM decapsulation failures rates"}

Implementations MUST protect the ML-KEM private key, the key-encryption key, the content-encryption key, message-authentication key, and the content-authenticated-encryption key. Disclosure of the ML-KEM private key could result in the compromise of all messages protected with that key. Disclosure of the key-encryption key, the content- encryption key, or the content-authenticated-encryption key could result in compromise of the associated encrypted content. Disclosure of the key-encryption key, the message-authentication key, or the content-authenticated-encryption key could allow modification of the associated authenticated content.

Additional considerations related to key management may be found in {{?NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5}}.

The security of the ML-KEM algorithm depends on a quality random number generator. For further discussion on random number generation, see {{?RFC4086}}.

ML-KEM encapsulation and decapsulation only outputs a shared secret and ciphertext. Implementations SHOULD NOT use intermediate values directly for any purpose.

Implementations SHOULD NOT reveal information about intermediate values or calculations, whether by timing or other "side channels", otherwise an opponent may be able to determine information about the keying data and/or the recipient's private key. Although not all intermediate information may be useful to an opponent, it is preferable to conceal as much information as is practical, unless analysis specifically indicates that the information would not be useful to an opponent.

Generally, good cryptographic practice employs a given ML-KEM key pair in only one scheme. This practice avoids the risk that vulnerability in one scheme may compromise the security of the other, and may be essential to maintain provable security.

Parties MAY gain assurance that implementations are correct through formal implementation validation, such as the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) {{CMVP}}.

# IANA Considerations {#sec-iana-considerations}

None.

Within the CMS, algorithms are identified by object identifiers (OIDs). All of the OIDs used in this document were assigned in other IETF documents, in ISO/IEC standards documents, by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
